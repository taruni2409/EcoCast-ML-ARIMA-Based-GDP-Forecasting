# üìä Clean Merge of Economic Indicators for Better GDP Insights Using ML & DL Techniques

This project focuses on merging and modeling economic indicators from multiple global datasets to enhance GDP forecasting. Using both Random Forest and ARIMA models, it analyzes data for the top 20 global economies, exploring both linear and nonlinear dependencies among key economic factors.

## üìù Abstract

Global economic instability, inflation, and fluctuating indicators like unemployment, energy use, and exports make GDP forecasting complex but crucial. This project builds machine learning and deep learning pipelines that clean, merge, and analyze large economic datasets to make more reliable GDP predictions. These predictions can support decision-making for governments, investors, and policy makers.

## üìä Model Comparison

In this project, both Random Forest and ARIMA models were employed to predict GDP and related economic indicators. Random Forest demonstrated superior performance in capturing complex, non-linear relationships among multiple variables, making it well-suited for multi-variate economic forecasting. It consistently produced lower error metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE across most countries, especially in stable economies like France and Japan.

On the other hand, ARIMA excelled in forecasting single-variable time-series data such as CPI and energy usage, particularly when trends were smooth and historical patterns were consistent. However, ARIMA struggled with dynamic and volatile economies due to its limited capacity to handle multiple predictors or abrupt non-linear shifts in data. Compared to Random Forest, ARIMA's accuracy was lower and its error metrics were higher, particularly for countries with irregular economic trends like India and Brazil.

Overall, Random Forest was more effective for comprehensive GDP prediction using multiple indicators, whereas ARIMA served better in simpler, trend-focused tasks. The choice of model should be aligned with the data structure and forecasting complexity.
